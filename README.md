Hangman Game:
This is a Python implementation of the classic Hangman game. The objective of the game is to guess the hidden word, one letter at a time, before the player runs out of attempts.

Features:
1: Random Word Generation: Each game selects a word randomly from a predefined list of words.
2: User Input: Players can input letters to guess the word, and incorrect guesses reduce their remaining attempts.
3: Win/Lose Condition: The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.
4: Simple and Intuitive: Easy-to-understand interface for anyone to enjoy.
